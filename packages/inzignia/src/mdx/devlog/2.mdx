I optimized the website layout to be more mobile&#8209;friendly. I recognize that the bunny&#8209;forward design is rather eccentric, but so is zigMOO. <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ‘½</span> In the next few devlog posts, I'm going to talk about different things in React that I worked on for this website. A lot of what's coming up is inspired by [Jose Comeau's amazing blog](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/), which is a must&#8209;read if you're interested in beautiful, accessible web design.
