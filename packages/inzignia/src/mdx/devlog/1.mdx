Welcome to a new corner of the internet: zigMOO! These entries will reflect on the development process for zigMOO games and provider deeper insights where possible. First up on the agenda: the creation of this website. This site was made with <span role="img" aria-label="love">❤️</span> in Gatsby and uses MDX. Over time, additional resources like a Discord community and wiki will become available.

zigMOO is the culmination of years spent tinkering with MOO and experimenting with new game formats. MOO's scripting language promotes rapid protoyping and is incredibly flexible, lending itself to a new type of game design process. Because it's a natural hub for discovery, MOO is even used in academic environments for scientific research.

Inspired by this legacy, zigMOO is an indie developer studio creating browser&#8209;based games with a one&#8209;of&#8209;a&#8209;kind MOO framework. I'm excited to share more about the framework in future posts!
