- zigMOO is an indie game studio creating innovative **browser&#8209;based games** that **champion accessibility**.
- **All zigMOO games share a persistent world simulating a virtual reality**. The actions in one game can impact the events in another, providing **opportunities for emergent gameplay**.
- Powered by **MOO** (**M**UD, **O**bject-**O**riented) and **TypeScript**, we believe games can be **creative adventures** that have a **positive impact** on the world.
